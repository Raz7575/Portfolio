Viewports and Responsiveness

For responsiveness, I used three separate CSS files:

Mobile: max-width 480px
Tablet: 481px to 768px
Desktop/Laptop: min-width 769px

I picked these breakpoints because they cover the main device sizes (phones, tablets, laptops/desktops). The site changes styles depending on screen size to make it easier to read and navigate.

Gradients

I used a linear gradient and an angled gradient on the Footer. This makes the site look more modern and adds some color styling instead of flat colors.

Color Scheme

I chose a color scheme using Adobe Color. The main colors are Blue, grey, white, and black, as those were some of the most popular for UI. I used this scheme across the whole site for consistency and to keep it simple but clean.

Testing and Validation
HTML Validation: I tested all pages with the W3C HTML Validator. Fixed errors like unclosed tags and attribute issues.
CSS Validation: I tested each CSS file with W3C CSS Validator, fixed the warnings.
Link Checker: I ran the W3C Link Checker to make sure all links between pages work.
Spell Check: Checked my text for spelling errors.
Accessibility: Tested with WAVE to make sure the site is accessible (alt text on images, proper headings, etc.).
